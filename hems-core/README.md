# HEMS-Core

HEMS Core is the backend API for managing a hybrid smart home environment that combines simulated (virtual) and real devices. It serves as the core of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS), enabling seamless integration between real-world smart devices (via Home Assistant) and virtual devices used for testing, simulation, and optimization research.

This project provides a scalable and extensible interface to monitor and control energy usage in residential settings, supporting both live deployment and research-driven simulation.
